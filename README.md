A Discord bot that pulls your most recent game from Chess.com, converts it to a gif, then displays it in your Discord server

![](https://github.com/Ethan-Hinds/DiscordChessBot/blob/main/Demo.gif)

Use !add to link your Discord account to your Chess.com username. Then, you can use !game to view your most recent game.
Also accepts other arguments: !game # # to display only certain moves in your game (Ex: !game 5 10 only displays moves 5 through 10)
Use !delay to set the time (in ms) between moves in the gif
